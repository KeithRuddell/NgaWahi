### Ideas for things to do with place names

 - Pandas/Rstudio? Something else? Are there 

 - Basic stuff: are there fields missing? Where are the hills? The streams/creeks/rivers/forests/plains?

 - Remember always what the Gazette is as a cultural artefact.

 - Most common place name in NZ -- is it Waitangi or Wainui? What others are oft-repeated

 - Break down into morphemes, particularly Maori names e.g. Wai-nui, Puke-totara. Watch out for false breakdowns, e.g. 'Manuka'=/='Manu'+'ka' [Shouldn't macrons help with this particular case? MƒÅnuka is 'tea-tree' but manu is 'bird' and the first vowels are differentiated by length]

 [Maori as an official language should be supported -- personal and place names with macrons]

 - Similarly, tracing Pakeha placenames etymology automatically -- matching with British localities/surnames, which are themselves in turn Norse/Saxon/Celtic/Latin etc...

 - Palmerston North, Totara North, Waimate North -- how many others are there? Are there any Waikikamukau Souths?

 - Can we catch names which *are* Maori (or Maori-origin) but are mis-spelled/dialectised to varying degrees: e.g. 'Mangtoetoe [sic] Stream', 'Tolaga Bay', 'Otago', 'Whangaroa Harbour', 'Parahaki/Parihaka' in Whangarei, etc...
 [disappointingly, 'Kaigoose' appears to be missing from the database -- does Google or anyone else have it in their NZ maps?]

 - Need to do something with mapping. gaz_names.csv has lat and long for every name
